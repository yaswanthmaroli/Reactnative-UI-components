// 12. TouchableNativeFeedback - This component is specific to Android and provides touch feedback using the native ripple effect. It's designed to give a more native feel to touch events on Android devices.
// 13. SafeAreaView -SafeAreaView is a component in React Native that is used to ensure that your content is displayed within the safe area of a mobile device's screen. The safe area is the portion of the screen that is visible and not obstructed by notches, status bars, or other device-specific elements. SafeAreaView helps ensure that your UI elements are not obscured by these areas, providing a consistent and visually appealing layout.

It allows users to refresh the content of the view by pulling down and releasing, which triggers a refreshing action. This component is commonly used for implementing a refresh mechanism in lists or other scrollable content.
// 21. pressable -Pressable is a touchable component in React Native that provides a flexible and accessible way to handle touch interactions. It is introduced as an alternative to traditional touchable components like TouchableOpacity and TouchableHighlight and is designed to support various user interactions, including pressing, hovering, and more.
// 22. VirtualizedList -s the underlying implementation used by both FlatList and SectionList. Itâ€™s a high-performance list component that efficiently renders only the items currently visible on the screen, regardless of the size of the data set. VirtualizedList is the recommended choice when you need fine-grained control over list rendering and want to create a custom list component.
